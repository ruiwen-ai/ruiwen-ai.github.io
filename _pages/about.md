I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en).
I recently completed my Ph.D. at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), where I was supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://michaelbackes.eu/)  and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and security,with a particular interest in exploring the role of data in adversarial machine learning.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019. I completed a summer research internship at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of [Prof. Tsuyoshi Takagi](http://crypto.mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/members/takagi.html), where I focused on the security evaluation of LWE-based cryptosystems. Following that, I did my final year thesis at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the guidance of [Prof. Yu Yu](http://yuyu.hk/). 

I am passionate about applying my research to real-world problems and welcome opportunities to collaborate with industry and academia to advance the state-of-the-art in machine learning security and privacy.
